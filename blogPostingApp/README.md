# Blog Posting TUI

Hello! This is the directory for a terminal UI to write posts for the server in the other part of the repo.

## Usage Guide

It's fairly easy. You have to set a `BLOG_BASEURL` environment variable so that the app knows where to send your posts. When the platform boots up, it logs out a random integer marked "Random thingy" **_NOTE THIS DOWN_**, it is the secret you need to plug into the "Site Secret" field. Tags are comma-seperated and split into the necessary boxes on in the app.
