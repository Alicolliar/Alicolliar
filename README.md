# Hi, I'm Ali

[My Website](https://alicolliar.net)

I'm a Software Development Apprentice in the UK. Most of what you see here are personal projects, which are mostly written in Python, because that's the language I started with and it's easy.
I've now branching out in to other languages and frameworks, such as Go and Javascript/Typescript, which I use at work. They're a mix of made-up "finance" projects, hackathons, university projects or other stranger things.

### My personal "greatest hits" of my public repos

- [political-bot](https://github.com/Alicolliar/political-bot) - This one is one of the first projects I remember that other people actually saw and used, and that's really cool to me. It's a fork, yes, but I hope I added enough for it to be considered it's own thing.
- [nwc-trade-\*](https://github.com/nwconifer_technical/) - The 3 repos here ([server](https://github.com/nwconifer-technical/nwc-trade-server), [frontend](https://github.com/nwconifer-technical/nwc-trade-frontend) and [bot](https://github.com/nwconifer-technical/nwc-trade-bot)) were another made up finance thing, written as a Go REST API, a NextJS JS frontend and a Python Discord bot.
- [text-Battleships](https://github.com/Alicolliar/text-Battleships) - Honestly, I just really liked this one, it's pretty cool, and while it don't work, I'm still pleased with it.
- [advancedHigherProj](https://github.com/Alicolliar/advancedHigherProj) - The project that got me my A in Advanced Higher Computing, I'm pretty pleased with her.
- [Trolligarchian-Financial-Systems](https://github.com/Alicolliar/Trolligarchian-Financial-Systems) - Currently, my single largest complete project. It is fully explained [over here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SL6t8Y1GYr_gR_KVtozvuWSTph0yeuYzRQXMKdAHktE/edit?usp=sharing), but it was... an experience.
- [Guts_project](https://github.com/Alicolliar/Guts_Project) - A fork of a team I was in's entry to the Glasgow University Tech Society's 48-hour Hackathon "Do You Have The GUTS?". This grabbed second (I don't really know how) and I didn't get much sleep while building it.
- [deep-feelings-of-inadequacy](https://github.com/Alicolliar/deep-feelings-of-inadequacy) - Another stock exchange, this one for DemocracyCraft, a democracy RP thing based in Minecraft. It may not have taken off, but I still enjoyed it
