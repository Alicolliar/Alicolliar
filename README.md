# Hi, I'm Ali

I'm a Software Development Apprentice in the UK (namely the north bit). Most of what you see here are personal projects, which are almost solely written in Python, because that's the language I started with and it's easy. The majority of my current projects are made-up finance things, mostly websites using the Python Flask module but also some other python things.

### My personal "greatest hits" of my public repos
- [political-bot](https://github.com/Alicolliar/political-bot) - This one is one of the first projects I remember that other people actually saw and used, and that's really cool to me. It's a fork, yes, but I hope I added enough for it to be considered it's own thing.
- [DefCon](https://github.com/Alicolliar/DefCon) - Some of the first, big, code I wrote. It's a nightmare, yes, but I still think it did alright. It's been really my only big real world project, and that earns it a special place in my heart.
- [text-Battleships](https://github.com/Alicolliar/text-Battleships) - Honestly, I just really liked this one, it's pretty cool, and while it don't work, I'm still pleased with it.
- [advancedHigherProj](https://github.com/Alicolliar/advancedHigherProj) - The project that got me my A in Advanced Higher Computing, I'm pretty pleased with her.
- [Trolligarchian-Financial-Systems](https://github.com/Alicolliar/Trolligarchian-Financial-Systems) - Currently, my single largest complete project. It is fully explained [over here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SL6t8Y1GYr_gR_KVtozvuWSTph0yeuYzRQXMKdAHktE/edit?usp=sharing), but it was... an experience.
- [Risk-For-Thing](https://github.com/Alicolliar/Risk-For-Thing) - My most recent fully complete project, that has really got me vibing with data science and maths.

### Want me to work with you on a thing?
If you've looked through the greatest hits and haven't left/died yet, you're mad. But if you still wanted to work with me on something then, umm, IDK, open an issue on Alicolliar repo and I'll get back to you whenever I can.
